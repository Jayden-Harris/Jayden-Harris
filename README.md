## About

I specialize in building backend systems, secure APIs, and experimental architectures rooted in complex logic. My focus is on clean, testable code and practical implementation. I actively explore encoding systems, virtual machines, and simulations—ranging from CRUD API scaffolds to symbolic technologies like Collatz-based encoding engines.

I’m currently focused on refining a portfolio of simple but effective backend projects to support freelance and contract opportunities.

## Technical Proficiencies

**Languages & Frameworks**  
- Python, Node.js, JavaScript, C++  
- FastAPI, Express, Flask (light usage), basic React

**Backend Architecture**  
- RESTful API design  
- JWT authentication  
- SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- Middleware and controller-layer patterns

**Other**  
- Git & GitHub  
- Unit testing (Pytest, Jest)  
- Docker (introductory knowledge)  
- Systems thinking and simulation modeling

## Current Focus

- Designing lightweight, production-ready CRUD APIs  
- Implementing secure user auth with token-based access  
- Developing Collatz Parity Encoding (CPE) for reversible binary encoding  
- Building a Collatz-based virtual machine with a custom instruction set  
- Creating simulation tools for nuclear reactor logic and virtual processors

---

## Development Philosophy

- Simplicity, modularity, and clarity in code  
- No unnecessary dependencies  
- Preference for handwritten logic over abstraction  
- Understand the system, not just the syntax

## Contact

View the repositories, read the code, or reach out if you have serious projects or collaboration opportunities. I'm not interested in hype—only in systems that work and ideas that challenge norms.
