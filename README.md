## About Me

I am fascinated by the **boundaries of computation, intelligence, and emergent behavior**. My work spans from designing **abstract virtual machines and assembly languages** to exploring **experimental AI systems** and probing the philosophical implications of **quantum mechanics**.  

I approach technology as a **sandbox for thought experiments**—a way to model, simulate, and interrogate complex systems. Projects like the **Collatz Virtual Machine (CVM)** and **Project Atlas** are as much about exploring ideas as building functioning systems.  

My goal is to create **computational environments that are self-contained, expressive, and thought-provoking**, merging formal logic with emergent, unpredictable behavior.

## Core Interests & Projects

- **Collatz Virtual Machine (CVM)** – a symbolic, self-contained virtual machine with a custom assembly language (CAL), designed to explore computation, reversible encoding, and virtual OS environments.  
- **Collatz Parity Encoding (CPE)** – a reversible binary encoding system for symbolic computation and experimental instruction sets.  
- **Project Atlas** – an experimental AI “thought engine” exploring internal feedback loops, emergent reasoning, and agentive behavior in algorithmic systems.  
- **Quantum-inspired computation & philosophy** – studying superposition, entanglement, and the role of observation in probabilistic outcomes; exploring the “Agentive Particle Interpretation” as a conceptual model for determinism, bias, and micro-level choice in quantum systems.  
- **Virtual operating environments & emergent CLI systems** – simulating OS-level behavior in memory, abstracted from the host, for safe experimentation in symbolic computation.

## Philosophy

- I build **systems that think**, not just code that runs.  
- **Emergence, bias, and feedback loops** are central to how I approach both AI and virtual computation.  
- I treat computation as a **medium for thought experiments**, where architecture, instruction sets, and encoding are tools to explore higher-order ideas.  
- I am less interested in conventional applications and more in **exploring the unknown**—the intersections of logic, probability, and agency.

## What Drives Me

- Understanding **why a specific outcome occurs** in complex systems.  
- Exploring **emergent behavior** as computation across layers of abstraction.  
- Creating environments where **experiments in AI, computation, and virtual systems** can be safely and rigorously executed.  
- Bridging **philosophical inquiry and engineering**, using code as a lens to examine reality, choice, and deterministic vs. probabilistic systems.
